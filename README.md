# Star Wars 
Built with React and custom design elements, and powered by the SWAPI (Star Wars API), I developed a web application with seamless data integration to explore the Star Wars universe.

The web app features interactive data access for characters, films, starships, vehicles, planets, and species, including dynamic searching, cross-referencing, and a responsive design for all devices.

Key challenges included implementing dynamic API fetching with error handling, managing SWAPIâ€™s paginated data, and enhancing the user experience with loading states, error boundaries, and reusable components.
